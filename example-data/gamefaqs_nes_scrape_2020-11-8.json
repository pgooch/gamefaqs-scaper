It's time for full-speed, high contact hockey, the kind of bone-jarring action played by the pros. The puck is dropped, you take control, center it and... Whoa! Your opponent viciously checks you from behind, making an incredible steal. You charge after him, crushing him against the boards. Suddenly tempers flare, off come the gloves, and you're swinging fists like a prize fighter. What action! You can even rack up assists like the great you-know-who. Or play goalie in the slap shooting penalty scenes. So strap on Blades of Steel. And imagine those immortal words - \"He shoots, he scores!\"",

Judging from the slightly suggestive ending, it was likely used to test the screen drawing code and not actually intended to appear in the final game.Screen FF is identical to the Evil King's chamber seen in-game, except the Evil King is missing.

One by one the planets' central life support computers had been infected with a life-threatening virus while the planet surfaces had been overrun with giant computerized dinosaurs known as Robosaurs. Under attack in his laboratory on Alpha Planet, Professor Proteus, the mastermind of the Spondylus System and founder of the Robosaur project suddenly realized that this deadly sabotage could only be the work of his former partner, the deranged Dr. Brainius. Years earlier, the doctor had fled Alpha Planet after Professor Proteus had exposed him for performing forbidden robotic experiments on human subjects. At last, he had returned to seek his revenge using the Professor's own creations! But, little did he realize that Proteus had been hard at work for the past few years perfecting the ultimate robosaur, Cyborasaurus! There was only one hope to save the Spondylus System. Cyborasaurus must be unleashed! The DYNOWARZ must begin!",

By eschewing conventional leveling for a proficiency system that allows players to tailor their characters' growth and incorporating a key term memory system that makes dialogue integral to gameplay, this game sparked the spirit of innovation for which the series has become known.\n\nThis release also contains the bonus dungeons added to later editions of the game--the Soul of Rebirth and the Arcane Labyrinth.",

The fun will have to wait. Jason has decided to come to camp and terror is the only game they'll be playing. Only you can stop this terror. You and your six camp counselors can prevent Jason from running wild. It's not an easy task. You must first fight your way through forests filled with man-eating wolves, caves covered with blood-sucking bats, and hordes of mindless zombies at every turn. If a friend is in danger it's up to you to help... or else you can just kiss them goodbye. Jason doesn't play favorites. He'll take anyone. Don't think that hiding in a cabin or staying adrift in a canoe will keep you safe. The only way to survive this summer is to challenge Jason, face to face, and destroy him. Don't worry that it hasn't been done before... there is always a first time (well, not always).",

    "description": "Jackie and his sister, Josephine, are tough on tyrants. As China's supreme kung fu champs, they guard their country against the Prince of Sorcerers, who lurks just beyond the Great Wall. It comes as no surprise when this fiend and his ghouls try yet again to seize China for themselves. But this time they're clever, casting a spell over Josephine which causes her to vanish into thin air! Jackie is in shock! How can he save his country without his sister? The two have been an unbeatable team! Meanwhile, a demon horde led by the Sorcerer storms the Great Wall and prepares to establish a fierce empire. At the urging of his revered Master, Jackie must now battle the dreaded Sorcerer and rescue Josephine. Maybe he can learn a little magic on his own, because he's going to need all the help he can get!",

But when a sweet young cheerleader named Sandy disappeared into the basement, boyfriend Dave knew it was time to take a look behind the good doctor's door. Your task is to help Dave choose a rescue team and guide them on the wildest, wierdest mission your NES system has ever seen. The storyline depends on the individual talents and quirks of the team members you select, and no matter how many times you play, the outcome is never quite the same. Sometimes it's puzzling, sometimes scary, sometimes downright funny, but it's always, always a challenge. So if you're looking for a comedy-adventure that makes you think as hard as you laugh, get into Maniac Mansion today. And then try, just try, to get out!",

Only one robot remains who can put a stop to Wily's plans and restore world peace: the heroic Mega Man.\n\nWHAT IS MEGA MAN\nThe original Mega Man captivated users at the time of its release with its challenging gameplay and innovative concept of taking the weapons from your enemies, then using them to exploit weaknesses in the bad guys yet to come.\n\nMODES\nThis version features a choice of two difficulty modes.\n\n* Normal Mode - (Unlimited continues) The continue screen is displayed whenever Mega Man dies. Selecting Continue allows you to restart from the last checkpoint you passed in the current stage.\n* Hard Mode - This challenging mode limits your number of continues, and enemy attacks deal more damage. There are also fewer checkpoints within stages.\n\nOPTIONS (The following settings can be adjusted in-game.)\n* Sound - Increase the number to raise the volume.\n* Vibration - Set to \"On\" to have your device vibrate when Mega Man takes damage. (Default setting: On) Note: This option will not be displayed on devices with no vibration function.\n* Attack - Auto: Hold the attack button for rapid-fire Mega Buster shots.

Rockman (sometimes shortened to Rock) is the main character of the series, who became known as MegaMan everywhere else.

    "description": "Don't let the name fool you - Pinball Quest is much more than video pinball. In fact, it's the first-ever multi-screen fantasy in a pinball format! Every move you make tells a story; every shot takes you another step closer in your quest to rescue the captive princess of the castle. Along the way you'll meet ghosts, goblins, witches and demons, in an endless labyrinth of treacherous passages and deadly doorways. It takes a fearless heart and a fast mind to conquer Pinball Quest. It also takes the skills of a true pinball wizard... which you can hone on the three other video pinball games included on this cartridge! So before you pour any more money into your NES library, get the one title that's a library all by itself! No matter how hard you try, you can't get enough of Pinball Quest!",

Unfortunately, she is presently in the hands of the great Koopa turtle king.\nMario, the hero of the story (maybe) hears about the Mushroom People's plight and sets out on a quest to free the Mushroom Princess from the evil Koopa and restore the fallen Kingdom of the Mushroom People.\nYou are Mario! It's up to you to save the Mushroom People from the black magic of the Koopa!\n\nDUCK HUNT\nThis fact action target game takes you into the marshes with your trusted hunting dog at your side. He'll flush out your prey, then it's a split second timing and sharp shooting accuracy to bag these ducks. Take on one duck or two at a time, and then as a true test of marksmanship, try clay shooting - the ultimate challenge!",

But that's just for starters. You'll be piloting the next generation of pursuit craft, including a super-charged racer, aqua blaster water craft and turbo copter. Assuming you can manuever through twists and turns at maximum turbo force, you'll need to blast a menacing Boss at the end of each stage. To survive you better have reflexes, guts and a sixth sense to avoid disaster. With the speed and G-force-inflicting action of a super chase into worlds you've never imagined, Super Spy Hunter is light years beyond the original. And with multi-dimensional graphics and sound effects that bombard your senses, it'll take everything you've got. Super Spy Hunter. It's a manhunt at the speed of light.",

Switch and shuffle to save the day! Stack two of a kind and they both disappear. Or, capture the whole bunch in-between egg shells. When the egg shells match, out hatches Yoshi and up goes your score! The action heats up as the characters fall faster and faster. If your piles get too high, the game is over. Choose your difficulty level and play for a high score or challenge a friend in a head-to-head hatch-off! If you like Dr. Mario, but you're ready for a whole new kind of challenge, you'll love this quick-shuffle action puzzle game!",

However King Drake of Phoebus has declared all magic illegal - magickers have been slain or fled into exile. In retaliation, enemy islands have threatened to unleash their guardian dragons, the most destructive force in the world. While docked at a harbor in Dilmun, you are arrested on suspicion of spellcasting. Imprisoned and stripped of everything but your wits, you are sentenced to life in a cesspool called Purgatory. Magic is you only salvation - a worldly possession in a world possessed.",

Use them wisely along the way to evade evil Draconian patrols. Keep one step ahead of the malevolent Dragonarmies while battling Dragons, Giant Wasps, Griffins, Wraiths, Zombies, and scores of other monsters! All the terrors of the journey, however, pale in comparison to the sheer horror of your destination. The impenetrable fortress of Pax Tharkas looms before you, crackling with vile energy.",

Players take on the role of baby Upa, a prince of the Akuyo kingdom. Prince Upa must take on an adventure spanning seven different worlds in order to rescue the kingdom from the dangerous demon Zai. Upa must defeat the enemies he meets along the way by inflating them. Upa can then use these floating enemies to his advantage by bouncing off of or riding on top of them. The prince must also avoid deadly thorns and pits while keeping an eye out for helpful items such as milk (to restore health) and bells (for temporary invincibility) if he hopes to succeed. If youre looking for a cute and solid platformer with a hero unlike those in most other games, then look no further than BIO MIRACLE BOKUTTE UPA.",

Mr. Gimmick is a mystical, exhilarating, and very dangerous adventure that begins where all other games have ended. Violent enemies that suddenly become your ally, if you know the secret. Magical items hidden away in secret places that ensure your survival if you find them and prevent you from even finishing the game if you don't.\n\nMr. Gimmick's only weapon is a cosmic star with a potent form of energy you must harness. Master it, and the star can cripple your enemies, carry you over dangerous territory, and enable you to reach levels - and hidden places - that are unattainable to anyone but an expert.\n\nEvery game you played before has only prepared you for this ultimate challenge. You'll call on many skills, techniques, and tricks you've learned to help Mr. Gimmick survive this evil onslaught. Only the strong will survive. And only the very best will experience the secret ending.",

JaJaMaru must use his throwing stars to defeat the monsters lurking in each of Dayuus many hideouts. JaJaMaru has to be careful though, as each monster has its own unique weapon and method of attacking. The only way for him to advance is to break the floor bricks above him and move up and down between the levels of each round, defeating monsters as he goes. To help him, broken bricks sometimes reveal items that JaJaMaru can use to his advantage, possibly leading to him getting the ultimate power-upa ride on Gamapakun, the giant frog! Take all this, throw in some bonus stages, and youve got a game with a style all its own!",

    "description": "A NEW STANDARD IN ACTION GAMES.\nDirect from Japan, where game design is treated as an art form, comes Thexder, an arcade game by which all others will soon be judged. Thexder offers more music, animation and game play, than you ever thought possible from a computer game.\nDESIGNED FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF COMPUTERS.\nThexder was created for second generation computers with 16-bit processors and advanced animation capabilities. The fine detailing of the artwork fully exploits the increased graphics capabilities now available, and the music (perfectly choreographed to reflect the action during play) will rival anything you've ever heard before.\nTHEXDER OFFERS A UNIQUE CHALLENGE!\nIn Thexder, players are given the chance to pilot a robot through multiple attack scenarios. The battlefields include caves, vast cargo holds and spaceship interiors. The robot also has the unique ability to transform into a fighter jet (and back again) at the touch of a button. Over 20 different types of aliens will do battle with you, and the challenge and music escalates as the game progresses.\nTHEXDER: AN ACTION GAME FOR TODAY'S COMPUTER OWNER.\nIt has been well over a decade since Americans were first introduced to computerized action games in the local arcades. Although the arcade game has almost disappeared here, the Japanese have continued their love affair with this form of recreation. Thexder reflects the maturity and refinement of almost two decades of arcade playing. Its colorful animation and hypnotic music will seduce even the most jaded computer owner into playing action games once again.\nOVER ONE-HALF MILLION UNITS SOLD FOR HOME COMPUTERS.\nThexder has proven to be one of the all-time bestselling arcade games in its country of origin. With its conversion to American machines, Thexder may just become one of the bestselling computer games worldwide! Thexder comes to America courtesy of Sierra, a publisher of quality computer entertainment products for over seven years.\nGAME ARTS.\nThexder was originally designed and programmed by Game Arts, a top publisher of recreational software in Japan. Sierra is very honored to be associated with this talented group of software artists.",

    "description": "Nintendo GOLF lets you choose your clubs, change your stance, control your swings - even select the angle of impact! You'll view the hole from both close up and far away, judge the changing conditions of the green, and measure the wind velocity. But watch out! When the wind changes, so does the flight of your ball. With Nintendo's state-of-the-art graphics and realistic game play, you'll really believe you're on the fairways. So play Nintendo GOLF, because there's not a video golf game on par with it anywhere!",

    "description": "Black and White. The battle of opposites... as old as time itself... comes to life in Othello. Its origins are part Western, part Eastern. Othello is fast-paced, as easy to learn as checkers, yet as fascinating as chess. Play against a friend. Or play against the Othello computer in four challenging skill levels. You play the black discs and your opponent plays the white. Trap his discs between two of your own, and his \"flip\" to your color. One move can change the entire game. Finding that move is the secret to Othello. That's why it takes a minute to learn... but a lifetime to master!",

Welcome to the world of Nintendo Pro Wrestling, where you take on six of the meanest, baddest, most rotten guys around. With names like The Amazon, Giant Panther and Kin Korn Karn. You'll begin the match by choosing a wrestler and an opponent - either the computer or a friend. Then with a flick of the wrist you'll perform drop-kicks, body-slams, head-locks and dozens of other bone-crunching moves designed to annihilate your opponent. But be warned. Each wrestler has his own arsenal of back-breaking moves. Which means you'll have to think fast and move even faster to pin your opponent, hold him for a three-count, and become champion of Nintendo Pro Wrestling!",

The fiendish King Rogles stands poised to conquer the other worlds of the universe: the Dream World of Queen Valia, and the Human World. Rogles and his five Dark Lords have taken the force of Yang from Queen Valia and sealed it into a Fantasm Jewel. Only a warrior with a heart perfectly balanced between Yin and Yang can wield the Sword of Valis against the encroaching darkness! Yuko, a young student from the Human World, is the chosen one - and you will control her. She is to become the greatest warrior in the universe, never suspecting that her most fearsome battle will not be  against a Dark Lord, but against her closest friend from the Human World - the one she warned, \"Don't go out with him, he's the Dark...\" But before she could finish, her friend ran off into The Darkness.",

This was censored in the game by giving the sides the names of Algon and Proton respectively; this is because you play, controlling the Proton (Japanese) navy, and end up changing history based on the ending's text (\"The battle is finally over. The Japanese army has dealt a devastating blow to the U.S. navy, claiming victory. Terms of peace will be negotiated...\") which implies that the Japanese won World War II rather than the U.S., at least in terms of the Pacific theater.",

Suddenly, the tranquility of the Milky Way erupts into a frothing fury as armadas of alien deathships swarm into our solar system like killer bees preying on an innocent bystander. No one is spared. Even beloved Mother Earth is stung. These vicious cosmic Visigoths are war starved Gyrusians. And, led by the immortal Genghis Khan (whom they recruited from Mongolia centuries ago), they're out to trash civilization. With our galactic fleet flattened, you're the lone space cowboy who escaped the Gyruss shroud of doom. Now you must scorch through the galaxy, freeing planets by zapping endless enemy attacks with Neo-Bomb-Blastic Cannons and Ultra-Lazonic Phasers. So prepare for the fight of your life. And don't flinch, or else the entire universe will get pulverized!",

His ghost goes on haunting the treasure...and all who try to find it...with a bloodthirsty vengeance that has chased strong men to their graves! But you have no fear..or do you? With a tattered old treasure map in hand, you must track down the sea dog's golden hoard, battling creatures both from this world from beyond the grave! You'll start the game with your trusty cutlass and your wits. Fight well and you'll be able to increase the power to slow down the hands of time and make your self temporarily invisible. Wield your cutlass well and you'll face the ghost of the Captain himself...with a chance to own all his buried treasure. But fail in your quest, and who knows what spirits will haunt you?",

    "description": "A generation has passed in the Kingdom of Llylgamyn since an intrepid band of adventurers regained the ancient armor of the Knight of Diamonds and the Staff of Gnilda. Under the protection of the Staff, and the wise guidance of those same adventurers and their descendants, Llylgamyn has become a place of beauty.\nRecently though, the peace of Llylgamyn has been disturbed, not by evil men and bloody conflict, but rather by the forces of nature itself. For years, unsettling tales of freak earthquakes, sudden changes in weather and mighty tidal waves have been whispered from ear to ear. Only the very foolish, and the very wise, heeded these warnings. But when the formerly peaceful seas around the island colony of Arbithea rose and swallowed it, and a massive earthquake damaged the temple of Gnilda, the citizens of Llylgamyn knew that something was very, very wrong. Some said it was the beginning of the end of the world itself!\nThe sages of Llylgamyn have agreed that there is but one hope, a mystical Orb guarded by the great Dragon L'kbreth. With it, they can at least determine what is causing the disasters now being reported almost every day. They call upon you, the descendants of the adventurers of \"Knight of Diamonds\", to take up their memories and their weapons, to seek mighty L'kbreth, and to win from her the Orb. Now you must go forth into the unknown to save your people...This is the Legacy of Llylgamyn!\n\"Legacy of Llylgamyn\" is the third scenario in the classic Wizardry series, acknowledged to be the most popular microcomputer fantasy role-playing game in history. It is the first scenario to be designed by the Wizardry Adventurer's Research Group (W.A.R.G.), whose members include Robert Del Favero, Jr., Joshua D. Mittleman and Samuel Pottle. The WARG group was responsible for playtesting the original Wizardry game.\nWatch for the fourth scenario \"The Return of Werdna\".\nFeatures:\n- Full screen 3D maze display\n- Revolutionary window graphics system\n- Improved combat sequence\n- 6 levels of hi-res mazes\n- For ages 10 to adult\n- For 1 to 6 players\n- This scenario for Wizardry characters of any level\n- Scenario designed by W.A.R.G.",

This world of the distant future has once again flourished under the guidance of the Great King, who harnessed the power of the 8 Eyes to rebuild the planet. These strange jewels of power were formed at the eyes, or center, of the eight nuclear explosions  which nearly destroyed the Earth. In the wrong hands, the 8 Eyes could cause untold destruction... And now, they have been seized by the Great King's eight Dukes, in a desperate bid to gain control of the world for themselves. They have banished the King to the nuclear wastelands, and already their squabbling threatens to plunge the world into war once again! The task of retrieving the 8 Eyes falls to you, Orin the Falconer, the bravest and mightiest of the King's Guardsmen. With your fighting falcon, Cutrus, you must penetrate each of the 8 Dukes' castles. There you will face the Dukes' soldiers, and battle strange nuclear mutants such as living skeletons, giant wasps, and mud men. You must defeat the monstrous Boss of each castle to retrieve the Jewel of Power he guards. Then, to complete your quest, return the 8 Eyes to the Altar of Peace to await the return of the Great King, so that he may finish the rebuilding of Earth. Your reward will be the eternal gratitude of all mankind!",

Firstly, the 52 games in Action 52 are particularly well-known for having clearly been rushed and without having gone through a thorough debugging and testing process, leaving the games glitchy and barely entertaining. Perhaps more interesting, however, is the game's terrible marketing scheme. The game was marketed so that it would often sell for $150 to $200 or more, in sharp contrast to the rarely-exceeded $15 to $30 the vast majority of NES games saw, on the basis that the player was getting 52 games for less than $4 each, in the vein of a bargain. Needless to say, once the atrocious quality of the games was publicized, few people cared about this \"bargain\".",

A pitching staff of junkballing lefties, flamethrowing righties, and crafty old relievers. But the key is to know when to use them, on any given day or play. You can tell a lot from your player's state - the most detailed in video baseball history, from streaks and slumps right down to each player's biorhythms - daily mood and physical condition. Beyond that, you have to rely on instinct alone. Because this is the \"SECOND SEASON.\" When baseball becomes a thinking man's game, a war of nail-biting drama, strategy and nerves. When a world championship rides on every pitch, and one wrong move can end your season. From the first costly error to the last clutch hit, this is baseball at its very best. A big step up from the original \"BASES LOADED\"... and a world away from any other video baseball game.",

It's so realistic you'll swear you can smell the infield barbecues!\n\nSlide into the roll cage of one of three ground-pounding 650 horsepower beasts. Then go head-to-head with \"Awesome Bill from Dawsonville\" and 14 of the nation's most relentless racers in three different skill levels. You'll face them in the Championship Season on the speed scorching banked ovals of Daytona and Talledega and the rubber-ripping corners of Sears Point and Watkins Glen. But test your skill and strategies in practice first. Or else you'll be stripped of your NASCAR license for good (what a disgrace).\n\nBut your adversaries are only half the battle. Depending on the type of track, you must decide between manual and automatice transmission, which engine, spoiler angle, gear ratio and tire stagger to use. Choose carefully, or you'll find yourself pacing the pits while your competitors are lapping you up.\n\nYou better feel the need for speed to enter the no guts, no glory world of NASCAR racing.

Her beauty and grace were known throughout the land - especially to Mad Mizer, the Dark Lord of the grim Groken Castle high in the Forbidden Mountains. He had vowed to make the Princess his queen; and so, one terrible day, he sent his ghoulish helpers to capture her, and she was carried off and imprisoned in one of the hundred miserable rooms of Groken Castle. News of the kidnapping spread throughout the kingdom, and many courageous young men braved the perils of Groken Castle in an attempt to rescue the Princess - only to become hopelessly lost in the complicated maze of rooms, ensnared in one of the many treacherous traps, or foiled by Mad Mizer's deadly servants. Finally the news reached the worthy Prince Rafael, who had long loved the Princess from afar. Raising his sword to the heavens, Prince Rafael swore that nothing would keep him from her side, and set out on his Castlequest. The odds against him seemed hopeless... But legend has it that two magical fairies have been held captive in the Castle for centuries. If the Prince can find and release them to gain their help, he may yet succeed in his quest. And to rescue his fair Princess, he is prepared to face the deadly wrath of the Dark Lord himself!",

    "description": "Castlevania was a cakewalk compared to this bloody curse. You thought you had the Prince of Darkness defanged - eh, Simon Belmont? Well think again, 'cause according to a damsel in distress, evil Count Dracula has left a horrifying curse in his wake. And the only hope you have of ending the terror is to destroy his missing body parts! Talk about your frightening quest, searching a maze of mansions, graveyards and dark, eerie forests - each guarded by man-eating werewolves, fire-throwing zombies and other devilish demons. Your grim chances are kept alive in Transylvania, where cowardly villagers offer clues to the whereabouts of Dracula's remains. And where you'll purchase magic weapons, including silver knives and flame whips. But beware the night. For when the sun disappears, Dracula's curse grows deadlier. And your chances grow dimmer and dimmer.",

    "description": "Led by the immortal Count Dracula, the greatest army of evil ever assembled is poised to bury mankind in a Tomb of Terror. Destroying this legion of Swamp Dragons, Slasher Skeletons and Forces of the Undead will be the supreme challenge for the mightiest of warriors. Your place in history is 100 years before Simon Belmont's birth. Dracula is young at heart, and it will take more than a stake to penetrate his evil. Luckily, you command the role of Trevor - Simon's forefather and the origin of the Belmont Warlord Chromosones. Trevor has a power never before seen by human eyes - the power to transform into three different spirits: Grant DaNasty, the ferocious Ghost Pirate. Sypha, the Mystic Warlord. And Alucard, Dracula's forgotten son. You must perfectly time Trevor's body transformations to match up his different fighting spirits against Ultimate Evils. Trevor also has the strength and wisdom to command the Battle Axe, Invisibility Potion and Mystic Whip. But the most important weapon Trevor has is your cunning to choose the correct Paths of Fate and your bravery to lead him past 17 possible levels of never-ending doom, including the Haunted Ship of Fools, the Sunken City of Poltergeists, the Clock Tower of Untimely Death and Curse Castle. Never before have so many dangers confronted you at one time. And if by some miracle you triumph, you'll no longer be a mere mortal. You'll be a legend who'll live forever!",

    "description": "When the Great War engulfed the world, bringing civilization as we know it to an end, it ushered in a new era of sorcery and magic. The magicians used their magic to keep order, and peace reigned for a hundred years... Until an evil magician named Draygon, seeking to control and dominate his fellow men, began to use his powers for destruction and conquest. To combat Draygon's evil, the other magicians constructed four powerful swords of wind, fire, water and thunder. Used together, the swords would transform into the mightiest weapon ever created: the sword Crystalis. But Draygon seized the weapons and scattered them far and wide throughout the land. Only one hope remained: A young lad, himself a great magician, who had been imprisoned in a cave and frozen during the Great War. Though they knew it might destroy them, the wise magicians pooled all of their powers in an attempt to revive him. When the boy awoke - his mind a blank, even his name forgotten - they had vanished, leaving him to find his destiny in this strange new world. In CRYSTALIS, you play the role of the young magician, making your way through Draygon's hostile land in an effort to locate the weapons you will need to defeat him. Draygon's monsters and black magic will threaten you at every turn, but you must not falter - only you can deliver the world from his scourge of evil!",

Even the fearful tale of King Amru's heroic battle with the demon Zawel had been long forgotten by his happy subjects. And when Amru's marriage to Alicia was blessed with the birth of the royal twins, Lace and Iris, the kingdom took it as a sign that the Fates were looking favorably upon them. But little did they know that far to the east the wicked Galda had been amassing an army of evil the likes of which could not be imagined in the blackest thoughts of mankind. Even the fearsome Zawel had been resurrected from the dead to join the murderous cause. Suddenly, without warning, Galda had struck, kidnapping Princess Iris and her attending maids for a sacrificial offering in the Ceremony of the Dark. As Amru lay helplessly on his death bed he knew there was but one hope for rescuing his beloved daughter and saving the kingdom from total destruction. He must finally reveal the secret of the magical sword of Arlia to his son, Prince Lace. The mighty spirit of the Blue Dragon must rise again!",

Soon the ancient elf town of Eolis will vanish into eternity. Only you can save Eolis. No one else dares to venture beyond the walls, onto the World Tree, where towns and fortresses precariously await the whims of fate at the hands of the Evil. You are searching for the water source and for an antidote to the poison that makes the water undrinkable. To find them you'll need gold and food and magic, speed with a sword... and luck. Every town holds a new mystery, every fortress a new danger. Merchants will sell you magic and valuable tools, but it's up to you to figure out what you need. Long, secret mantras help you slip through the mists, but will you survive the next challenge? This is Faxanadu, the legend, the adventure - the incredible journey on the World Tree!",

Use your Land of Mongols to build an empire on the bodies of your enemies and the rubble of their conquered cities. With skill, cunning, diplomacy and luck, all of Europe and Asia could be yours. Failure means shame in the eyes of your princess, or even death! Victory on the battlefield requires bold strategy and clever planning. Outmaneuver your opponent with cavalry, lay siege to his castle with archers or even challenge him to a duel. But success also requires brilliant political tactics and a sharp eye for business during times of peace. Genghis Khan is based on actual history and offers a blend of strategy and role playing elements. Make history as you play the great Khan himself or his rivals, Richard the Lionhearted, Emperor Alexious III, or Shogun Minamoto of Japan.",

Derbies, baseball caps, cowboy hats, wizard hats, top hats and crowns? Well, that's the whole idea behind Hatris. The hats keep coming at you two at a time. All you have to do is stack them up five at a time and - poof - they're history. It sounds perfectly simple. Until you get into it. Then you'll wish you had six heads instead of one. Because this is the latest game from Alexey Pajitnov, the designer of Tetris, and his partner Vladimir Pokhilko. And anyone who could turn geometry into a contact sport is a force to be reckoned with. And this time they really want you to use your head.

They blackmail him into stealing priceless works by Leonardo da Vinci from a heavily guarded auction house and from the Vatican itself! The job has Hawk dodging bullets and guard dogs, thwarting sophisticated security systems, dangling from rooftops and crawling through booby-trapped ventilation shafts. And if Hawk makes it out alive? Well maybe he can turn the tables on his blackmailers. Because they aren't just art collectors, they have a plot to rule the world!

All the elements of the major championships are here as well - the harsh winds of Scotland, the lightning fast greens of Augusta, Oakmont's death traps and the great ocean hazard at Pebble Beach. Trees are everywhere. Birdies are few. And it has more doglegs than a kennel. Even pin placements change from round to round, making double bogeys as common as pars. Up to a foursome can compete, or you can go it alone against a computerized Golden Bear. You also have the option of playing a skins game or stroke play. So get a grip on yourself.

But don't think that just being able to fight will get you through. This time it's not enough to just punch, kick and jump... this time your total martial arts training will be put to the test. Your discipline and inner control could be what saves your life. You must prove that you are capable of thinking, reasoning, and reacting. Catching a fly with your chopsticks or splitting blocks of ice with your bare hand is just as important as fighting face to face with your enemy. This challenge will take you to the streets of L.A., the back roads of Okinawa and many strange areas beyond. Always keep your mind clear and remember all that you've been taught, and maybe... just maybe... you'll make it!",

    "description": "Sun-bathed beaches from San Diego to Sydney are yours to conquer, as you challenge heavy-hitting volleyball superstars in world championship style competitions. From the opening serve to match point, the sand-blasting never stops. And to survive each grueling round, you must spike, crush, block and make daredevil returns. Timing and positioning are critical in this slam-fest, complete with aces, kills, digs and the dreaded hammer spike. Teamwork is crucial as well, since up to four players can compete at once. So hold nothing back, and bury your opponents in the sand. Because if your tandem wins three matches, you're qualified for the next big tournament, the next enormous challenge. But lose and you'll be just another couple of beach bums, washed-up like a pile of seaweed!",

In a stadium hundreds of years from now, techno-gladiators do battle, combining contact with speed and finesse. Two five-man teams go for it, each fighting to deliver a three-kilo metallic energy sphere into the opponents goal zone. Teams challenge each other in a surreal arena that utilizes devices such as a warp tunnel, ball launcher, and magnetically charged bounce domes. Klashball features a complete league system. There are 11 rowdy teams, each with unique skills, strengths, and weaknesses. After each match the central computer analyzes the outcome and records the stats. Play against the computer or klash it out with a friend. If you're ready, take a trip into the 23rd century with Klashball. A game so real, it's in your face!",

Never in your military career have you been in such a hot spot, as the world's most threatening power, Sheik Toxic Moron, deploys his arsenal of TechnoScorch Weapons. To achieve total victory over 4 intense levels, you must possess numerous skills, including precision reflexes for air combat, a cut throat mentality for land assaults, the brains to gather secrets from underground informants, and a keen sense for surviving 3-D battle mazes. If you've got the guts to match those skills, then prepare for action. Because it'll really heat up the second you blast across the Sheik's firing line, piloting the world's most advanced super weapon - the Mach 4 Laser Invasion Helijet, which can go from hovering to a six \"G\" vertical climb in a heartbeat. From the moment you activate your Vulcan Cannons and Sidewinder Missiles, you'll take dead aim on an insane assault, featuring Anti-Copter Rocket Launchers, High-Altitude Bombers and Aerial Mines. But the battle's just begun, and there's no time to kill between firefights!",

You can call on a starfighter friend from the planet Latis, who'll fight beside you in his RoadBritish space destroyer. You'll both be gunning for max power-ups, with ripple lasers, plutonic missiles and impregnable force fields. But you better be on target. For this isn't your ordinary space scum.

For reasons long forgotten, two mighty tribes went to war and touched off a blaze which engulfed them all. Without fuel they were nothing. Man began to feed on man. The gangs took over the highways, ready to wage war for a tank a gas. In the maelstrom of decay, ordinary men were smashed...men like Max -- a man who wondered out into the wasteland. And it was there, in that blighted place, that he learned what it takes to survive. \n\nAnd now it's your turn. Survive multiple levels of holocaust on the highways, mayhem in the mine-shafts, and anarchy in the arenas. Then face the final challenge -- if you dare.",

If this revolution succeeds, the safety of the entire world may be threatened... And that's where you come in. You must attempt to infiltrate the island base of the rebel forces. But before you even reach the shore, you'll have to contend with enemy gunboats, frogmen, choppers, and destroyers. If you make it to the island, you'll find it patrolled by enemy soldiers armed with machine guns, daggers and grenades; vicious attack dogs; and lethal airborne probes, programmed to destroy intruders on sight. Other unknown dangers lie in wait as well. But if you manage to reach the rebel headquarters, you will face the most terrifying threat of all - only no one has made it back to reveal its nature! You'll be equipped with a complete arsenal - an assault gun, rocket launcher and grenades - to provide you with a fully mechanized system of attack.

Responding to the crisis, covert unit \"Fox Hound\" is called into action, and that's where you come into play. Trained in hand-to-hand combat and skilled in every weapon known to man, you're Fox Hound's lethal fighting machine, code named \"Solid Snake\". But on this mission you better be sly as well, to surprise heavily-armed enemies, busting 'em up quietly and rescuing their hostages before alarms are triggered. Plus you gotta maintain radio contact with Commander South, who'll feed you crucial info on Metal Gear's whereabouts. To survive, capture sub-machine guns, Barettas, grenade launchers, and plastic explosives, until you find and destroy Metal Gear, ending CaTaffy's reign of terror!",

You will have to use your bubble attacks to fend off the castle baddies while busting up every block in sight trying to find all of the hidden treasure and other secrets throughout the game. Unlike most platformers, Milon's Secret Castle is less about defeating all of the enemies in an area, and more about scouring every bit of each room to find the secrets that lie within Garland Castle!  Milo can uncover practically anything in the game.  This includes:   items, power-ups, money, shields, keys, level exits, even shops!  The only way to get to each level boss is to find the right secret items!",

Also swiped was his computerized military defense system, which the evil thugs have reprogrammed to destroy the world. Now his future, and ultimately Earth's survival, depend on your crack Mission Impossible Team to perform a secret surgical strike and rescue. But to pull off this operation, you must be daring enough to command three different IMF identities - Max, Grant, and Nicholas. Each has special agent talents and firepower which you must master to survive six torturous levels with dozens of hidden Espionage Zones. So good luck, Jim. As always, should any of your IM Force be caught, the Secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions... THIS BOX WILL SELF-DESTRUCT IN 5 SECONDS!",

There's visual entertainment with the animated Rich Uncle Pennybags and Community Chest and Chance Cards, and the speedy sports car and other tokens that zoom around the board. Now listen for voice enhancemants such as the \"jailer\" who kicks Rich Uncle Pennybags out of Jail, and the digitized sound of the train whistles on the Railroad spaces. Like a real estate big shot, you let computer \"accounting\" keep track of your cash, assets, properties, houses and hotels. You can play with real, live real estate moguls, or take on the computer opponents, who might be beginners - or savvy big-time traders! The MONOPOLY game everyone grows up with, plus the NES... all in all, it's a real sweet deal!",

You can select any of the American and National Conference teams, and if you're good enough, you can take them all the way to the Super Bowl! Team rosters are broken down into positions and individually rated according to skills, with position upgrade packages, player ability handicapping, actual NFL Offensive and Defensive Playbook alignments with audibles and even variable wind direction and strength. You not only coach from the sidelines, you also control all the movements of the players on the field. Run, pass, catch, kick, punt, jump, tackle, block and dive... Refs even call penalties. No matter what kind of fan you are, whether you know the rulebook inside-out or just watch an occasional game on TV... this is the one football game you've got to have!",

By day this brave new crimefighter is a common ordinary citizen. But when night falls, he is cloaked in a secret identity to seek out and destroy the dark forces that lurk on midnight streets. Who is this man the press calls Nightshade? Only you can answer that... for he is you! Every night you solidify your superhero status, patrolling 100 of the city's darkest corners. Here you'll find thieves, muggers, and other alley scum that you must either deal with or destroy for clues. But be warned. You're not the only night stalker. For as you hunt Sutekh, Sutekh hunts you with the human printing press, the closing wall of spikes, deadly jackal pits, and the chilling freeze ray. Of course the ultimate key to destroying Sutekh is your popularity. For it's a power source that gives you the wit to decipher clues and the strength to pulverize villains and rescue innocent bystanders. Remember, if this heroic prowess ever diminishes, you'll no longer control the night. You'll be consumed by it.",

    "description": "A sadistic crime wave is sweeping through old Detroit. The situation is explosive - in fact, it is so bad, a private corporation, O.C.P., has assumed control of the police force. Then, a research team creates an unstoppable, indestructible law enforcement cyborg - named RoboCop. Using a wild assortment of weapons, including RoboCop's Special Issue Auto-9, you must stop every sleazeball criminal you encounter with deadly, piercing accuracy. But beware, there are forces on the street - and within O.C.P. - that will stop at nothing to see RoboCop eliminated. Make your way past 6 levels of street thugs, Boddicker and the powerful ED-209 to your final battle with Dick Jones. Prepare yourself for non-stop action in one of the most explosive games you will ever play. It's going to take more than a cop to clean up the scum of old Detroit - it's going to take RoboCop. \"Your move, creep.\"",

After his stunt plane was wrecked accidentally in a shootout between a couple of thugs and G-Men, the hoods had stashed an amazing stolen device in his cockpit. It didn't take long to figure out it was a rocketpack. And it took even less time for Cliff to become a target for half the city. The hoods wanted the stolen device back. So did its inventor, the famous, but eccentric American industrialist, not to mention the FBI, the U.S. Army, and the most menacing force of all, the Nazis! Even famous film star Neville Sinclair wanted the rocketpack. He had kidnapped Cliff's girlfriend, the gorgeous Jenny Blake, and was offering to exchange her for the device. Cliff had no time to ponder his desperate situation. There was only one course of action; he must become THE ROCKETEER!",

With their greedy eyes on RollerGames' mega prize money, they've corrupted three teams and kidnapped Emerson \"Skeeter\" Bankhead, the games' beloved commissioner. You and your own three teams of righteous skate kings must stop V.I.P.E.R.'s criminal venom from infecting the entire city. So you've got to take the fight to the streets. And the sewers, and the junkyards, and the highways and the jungles... through 6 stages of dastardly traps of doom as you leap over open manholes, careening oil drums and treacherous landslides. Race around oil slicks and man-eating canines. And avoid ambush by combat copters, bomb-wielding goons and creeps like Captain Meat Hook and the Fish Face. But time is against you. And so are V.I.P.E.R.'s judo masters, skateboard thugs, motorcycle madmen and other assorted sinister scum. If your multi-faceted fists can't punch you through, you'll need your special assault body blocks, jump kicks and double-whammy slams. It's a bone-crunching skate-athon for your life, Skeeter's life, and for the good of RollerGames. So vanquish V.I.P.E.R. before they melt your ball-bearings into bullets!",

An amazing warp suit, that allows movement through the dimensions, and the shockwave pistol, delivering tremendous bursts of energy. This energy is derived from special crystals, of which few remain. Rastons, ancient enemies of the Tarians, have returned to claim these relics. They have employed a dimension field generator to create a rift in space and time. The Tarian relics are the only chance of destroying the generator and sealing the tear... You have been chosen! Donning the warp suit and pistol, you must use the few remaining crystal shards to power your journey through the rift. You must solve the riddle of the mazes to defeat the generator and seal the rift. Tarian legends speak of mazes without end. Keep your wits about you! Return quickly, our universe is counting on you!",

    "description": "Welcome to Rodney's Winter Wonderland of tasty tournaments. A gnarly snow sport spectacular of five events - Snowboard Half Pipe, Snowball Blast, Inner Tube Thrash, Downhill Blitz, and Acro Aerials. Whether you're trying to win points or the judges' hearts, it's a torture test of slope-slicing skill for up to six skiers. But Rodney warns you the mountain's crawlin' with contest crashers like punk penguins, abnormal abominables, chainsaw-toting rabbits and bodacious polar bears. Frenzied freaks of nature who want you to cash it in on a snow bank. But buckle down and you'll rack up points for pulverizing all kinds of ski shack scum. Assuming, of course, you can swoosh past bear traps, trees and other ouch-inducing obstacles. And when you're not engaged in wild tubular warfare with twisted slope slime like Lester or the iglooheads, you must blind the keen-eyed judges with your brilliant backflips, ollies, pikes, hand plants, daffies and helicopters. Just stay cool while you hone your skills in practice or hot-dog it in competition. Because one bogus move and you'll be plowing the slope with your chin.",

Cinnamon - Super Genius.\n\nThe Attakons are scheming to zap the professor's brain, retrieving his secret bio-nuclear sweetener formula. A formula these evil-doers will use to transform Earth into an inter-galactic ball of cotton candy - a favorite munchie for Attackon sweet tooths. To save the world from this sticky fate, you'll soar into action in your highly advanced Stinger jet fighter, with its awesome array of wacky weapons.\n\nBut beware. From the beginning you'll be locked in dog-eat-dog dogfights, battling tooth and nail past Attackon defenses, from the South Seas to the Arctic Circle.\n\nThen prepare for the ultimate challenge - the Attackon Fortress on the edge of space, where the professor is held hostage, and where Earth's survival rests on your shoulders.\n\nFeaturing simultaneous play for two players or play against the computer.",

Perhaps a few details, before you volunteer. You'll have to be in great shape. The full extent of these caves is unknown, and you must be prepared to explore every square foot to succeed. So, a little dirt, a few cuts and bruises and total physical exhaustion doesn't scare you? OK, how about poisonous frogs, bats, snakes, scorpions, tarantulas, cavemen, lavapits and deadly condors? Oh, did we forget to mention Harry's niece, Rhonda, and his faithful companion, Quickclaw the Lion? They're both trapped below and must be saved before you leave the caves. Just a minor complication. Still with us? Good. Because it gets better and better - over 270 screens loaded with danger and adventure. New enemies and challenges at every turn. Sound like your cup of tea?

    "description": "Yo! After being treated like garbage by the Ninja Turtles, Shredder has trained a new, more merciless breed of Foot Soldiers to inflict his revenge: A clan of over 700 Taekwondo turtle terminators who have once again captured April O'Neil to use as turtle bait. Fortunately you don't have to face these freaks of torture alone. For the first time ever, two dudes or dudettes can join forces and double-team Shredder, kicking shell while covering each others tails. But to survive you've gotta fight through 8 action-packed arcade levels, including Vinnie's Valet \"Stalking\" Lot and the Soho Sewer System, plus two new never-before-seen shell-squashing stages! Each of these deathtraps is reinforced by lethal electro zappers, laser beams, freezer burners or enemies such as Scorpion Robots, Stone Warriors and Baxter Stockman. Shredder has also hired the all-powerful Tora and Shogun, two alien bounty hunters who have never known defeat. Even though Master Splinter has prepared the turtles well for battle, teaching them radical new attack moves, it doesn't mean this war to save April and turtlekind will be a piece of cake or even a slice of pizza. Because with the forces of revenge on his side and the bounty boys in town, it's payback time for Shredder!",

Legends say the original set of Tiles was created by gods and played as a game. Wizards said when played by mortals, it was an art that could be used to predict the future. Priests said it was a dangerous gamble that actually altered the flow of fate. Soon the art of the Tiles had spread across the whole of China, but with it something strange was also spreading. Droughts and then flooding, terrible famines and then gigantic harvests. Everyday something more strange and unlikely would occur, the forces of fate had indeed been blown out of control. The influence of the Tiles on the land of China had to come to an end, but it would not be easy. Like the force of Yin & Yang, each Tile has a match that when united, will allow both Tiles to achieve symmetry, and simply cease to exist. You must conquer 7 castles to defeat 7 sets of Tiles. It will take more than quick reflexes - you must use strategy, skill and luck to defeat the TILES OF FATE!",

This is WACKYLAND, a prankster packed park owned and operated by Montana Max, their arch villain who has cleverly disguised himself as a nice guy.\n\nSuddenly Plucky Duck is stuck behind the wheel of the world's bumpiest bumper car. Hamton is riding a wild west train, dodging obstacles and enemies. Furrball is hanging on for his nine lives atop a high speed log ride. Babs Bunny's stomach is doing flip flops as she hip hops from one crazy roller coaster car to another. And Buster Bunny is lost in a funhouse maze that's turning his life upside down. Think this is amusing? No doubt! In fact, it's a hare-splitting adventure that'll crack you up as you jump aboard five wild n' weird rides that'll throw you for a loopdy-loop.\n\nHang onto your ears - there's more! Like Roderick Rat, Batsy, Arnold the Pit Bull and Elmyra, four foes who will give you nothing but trouble. Shirley The Loon, a hard-nosed ticket taker who won't let you ride the next ride if you're too short (on points). And dozens of traps that are stickier than cotton candy. All in all, it's like five great games in one. Making Wacklyand today's biggest attraction for your NES.",

Because you've got to be quick on your feet and fast with your hands to become the next URBAN CHAMPION. You've got to block, fake and land punches that will knock your opponent off the screen. Do that three times and there will be a confetti celebration in your honor as you become the new URBAN CHAMPION. But watch out. Just when you think you've beat him to the punch, you fall into an open manhole! Or get hit by a falling flower pot! Think you can handle the action? Then prove it. Play it by yourself or challenge a friend, either way you'll have a knockout time defeating the toughest guys in the neighborhood in URBAN CHAMPION.",

Here you have it, the most excellent beach volleyball game ever! Locals say kicking the butt of a computer controlled team is never easy without a lot of practice. You haven't seen anything until you challenge a friend head to head in competitive double player action mode. Way rad beach volleyball action, blazing 8-bit graphics and killer tunes.

But the distant presence of evil stirs in his mind, leading him to the once fair city of Piedup, the very same place where the villainous soul of Malkil survives.

You'll battle oil rig fires, trying to save trapped workers. Use your Photon-Stick to zap gaseous garbage men on a high-speed plutonium mining car ride. Vertical jump through two separate screens to reach a venomous vixen who's single-handedly scorching the rainforests. And spin kick Smogger, a smoked-out scum of the Earth.\n\nFinally, try to survive a rescue mission stage. Rack up points in the bonus recycling level. And slash through 6 subgames that will lead you to the feet of Lord Contaminous, who you must dispose of before he trashes every living thing on the face of the Earth.\n\nFor 1 Ninja Master.",

By shooting strange magnetic rays, Darc Seed had turned the helpless nation into zombies and had brought the Statue of Liberty to life to do his dirty work. These rays had also given him control over many deadly weapons, but none were more powerful than the legendary samurai sword, Shura. When the great head of the samurai, Namakubi, heard that the sword had fallen into evil hands, he set off immediately for the United States. For only he possessed the strength and knowledge needed to recapture the magical sword and free the U.S. from the evil clutches of Darc Seed.",

With your army reduced to a handful and your artillery depleted, further resistance seems impossible. But in a hidden underground laboratory, a team of scientists has at last perfected a new kind of fighting machinery: a bionic arm that extends and contracts, providing unheard of strength and maneuverability. Combined with an arsenal of rapid-fire, armor-piercing and heat-seeking weaponry, this will put the power of an entire army in the hands of one man... one carefully chosen soldier, who has what it takes to become a new breed of unstoppable commando... a Bionic Commando. And you are that soldier! Your mission will take you through the heavily-patrolled wilderness surrounding the enemy headquarters and into the very heart of the fortress itself. Even to the most courageous soldier, it would seem an impossible challenge. But there has never been a soldier like the Bionic Commando!",

    "description": "The fire burns warmly, but casts little light into Mentors study. The flickering shadows only hint at the vast number of books and scrolls that fill the many shelves. Slowly Mentor walks over to the fire.\n\nWell my friends, your training is complete. You are not yet Heroes, you have yet to prove yourselves. But first, let me tell you of Morcar.....\n\nMany centuries ago, Morcar was my apprentice. He worked hard and learned quickly. But impatience devoured him, and he wanted to learn more powerful magic. I told him of the dangers, and that he should be patient, for in time he would become a great Wizard. But Morcar could not wait, each night he broke into my study and read my spell books. \n\nThe secrets that were held within them were great indeed. Once he had learnt these secrets, Morcar fled. When I caught up with him, I found him greatly changed. He had pledged his allegiance to the Great Powers of Chaos. Fool. He saw magic only as a shortcut to to power and paid no heed to the terrible price he would have to pay.\n\nI tried to reason with him, but to no avail. He laughed in my face and then unleashed a terrible spell that I was hard-pressed to counter. For many days we battled, but Morcar had allies stronger even than I, and I could not defeat him. In the end, as we both weakened, he fled and sought refuge in the Northern Chaos Wastes.\n\nThere he honed his skills, conjuring ancient powers with which to overthrow the Empire. But he knows not what he has done. They will serve him while it suits their own dark purposes. But in time they will destroy him. I must watch Morcar and measure the strength of this magic. This I may do with the help of Loretome.\n\nThe powers Morcar has called upon will destroy us all if I relax from this vigil. Morcar's legions have threatened us once before. Then it was Rogar who aided me and defeated them. Now they march again, already they have assailed the borderlands. The Empire must again look for heroes and to this end I have trained you.\n\n\nEach of you must complete three tasks. If you do this, you will be acclaimed as Champions of the Realm and dubbed Imperial Knights. Only then will you be on the road to becoming a Hero. I shall speak with you again on your return. If you return.....\n\nMentor...",

You always die in one hit, but there are unlimited continues in the normal difficulty as well as a password system to resume where you last left off.\n\nIn total, there are over 550 rooms, 8 bosses, and over 30 different types of enemies. You will also obtain items along the way that grant you new abilities such as higher jumping or slower falling in order to travel to new areas of the fortress.\n\nCan you survive the perils that lie ahead?",
