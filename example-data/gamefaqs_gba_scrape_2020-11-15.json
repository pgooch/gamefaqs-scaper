It is developed instead by Altus, who are famed for their Shin Megami Tensei and Etrian Odyssey, among other, series. As a result, most consider this game to not be canon amongst the other Shining games, even though many references are made to other Shining games, including the bosses in this game being all from other Shining games.",

It won't be easy, but you must help them take on a meddling Magikoopa and his entire cast of underhanded underlings.  Your journey spans the island's jungles, caves, and snowcapped peaks--each area filled with hidden rooms, secret passages, charming minigames, demented bosses, and all-new pals.  Sure, Yoshi looks cute, but he packs some pretty amazing firepower--he can throw eggs, hover, stomp, pound the ground, slurp up enemies, and morph into a toy submarine.",

Ms. Keene has given the girls a list of different items that can be found in the city. Along the way, Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup will run into familiar villains such as Mojo Jojo, Fuzzy Lumpkins, The Gangreen Gang, the Boogie Man, and of course... HIM.\n\nHim and Seek is a side-scrolling adventure game starring the Powerpuff Girls. There's no platforming required in this game, as the girls can fly everywhere. Instead, it plays like a combination of a beat-em-up and a point and click adventure game. The girls will need to perform tasks for Townsville citizens to get items for their scavenger hunt list, ranging from destroying crazy monsters, to finding lost wallets, to beating up the Gangreen Gang to get a tooth!",

    "description": "Step away from clear notions of good and evil, right and wrong. There are demons in the world, but whether they are ally or enemy depends on where you stand and what you do. In Tokyo 199X, a mysterious murder leads to the emergence of demons and an escalating global conflict with the rise of a charismatic rebel leader in possession of a demon army, and external forces that wish to crush such threats with extreme measures. You, the protagonist, have an unusual ability enabled by a computer program that lets you communicate with and recruit demons to your side. As you collect demons, the program will allow you to store, summon, and fuse them to create the right team to negotiate the ever-changing balance of powers, and fight for the kind of world you ultimately wish to live in.\n\nATLUS' revolutionary RPG series, Shin Megami Tensei, began on the Super Nintendo in 1992, and has gone on to sell millions of copies worldwide. It has further given rise to other hit RPG titles, including Persona, Devil Summoner, and Devil Survivor. Previously available only in Japan, this, the very first Shin Megami Tensei game, is available in English for the first time ever.\n\nKey features:\n\n- 40-60 hours of consuming RPG adventure\n- Explore dungeons and recruit demons to your party\n- Collect and fuse demons to make ever stronger demons\n- Your decisions will determine the fate of the world",

Now, a young hero and heroine must come together to defeat the evil that threatens both the mystical tree and the world itself.\n\n* Choose your hero! Guide a battle-hardened gladiator on his quest to avenge the deaths of his parents!\n* ...Or guide a young girl, one of the last survivors of the Mana Clan, as she confronts the past that haunts her. \n* Experience the saga of these two heroes as their stories weave together and they join forces to protect the Mana Tree from the forces of darkness.\n\nFans of Secret of Mana have waited over ten years for a successor to Square's SNES role-playing game, and now it's here. Sword of Mana shares the art style and action-oriented gameplay of its predecessor, but boasts a huge game environment, a new gripping storyline, and a deep class and upgrade system. You'll choose between playing a male or a female hero and slay enemies to upgrade your abilities. Sword of Mana blends its fast action and depth with classic RPG style and fun.",

In more than 20 different missions, you'll do everything from racing Vespa scooters and ice-skating to playing soccer and water polo. With each event, crowds of ducks (each duck with its own personality) may form around you--but try not to become nervous.",

    "description": "The normally quiet jungle is abuzz with excitement, because it's time for the ceremony to choose the king of the jungle! Or at least it would be if King K. Rool hadn't stolen the special medallion meant for the winner. Donkey Kong and his friends must swing their way through the jungle to get the medallion back and, along the way, rescue Diddy, Dixie, and Funky Kong from King K. Rool's minions. A unique control system lets you swing through the trees and spin to build up momentum for a mighty leap. Innovative level design combines elements of platform and puzzle games: Grab gears and spin to crank doors open. Watch out for bolts that loosen as you spin, or you might find yourself falling flat. You'll need steady hands to make the leap-of-faith that takes you to the treetops.",

No longer content just to wear different-colored overalls, Mario and Luigi also possess different skill sets (Mario can stop quicker, while Luigi can jump higher). In addition to the classic enemies already known to fans worldwide, there are also Poison Mushrooms, backward Warp Zones, and the occasional wind gust (which can help or hinder your progress) to take into account. And if thats somehow not enough, expert players can go looking for the games secret worlds. So get ready to put your Mario skills to the ultimate test, and save the Princess again. Just dont be surprised if shes in another castle!",

Players decide where to place apartments, hotel rooms, office spaces, restaurants, commercial shops, elevators, and a multitude of other construction items in their building. As the tower grows, players have to deal with a multitude of real life situations such as fires, insect infestations, burglaries, and of course the occasional unhappy tenant. Only with savvy design and wise management skills will the player's tower attract masses of patrons and tenants. The main goal in The Tower SP is to achieve a \"Five Star\" building rating and gain official \"Tower\" status. This can only be achieved by completing specific objectives and creating a building that is a marvel of both efficiency and design. Happy tenants play a large roll in the building's success. A large tenant base insures income to the building, but it is imperative that the building management keep its tenants happy. Unhappy tenants will vacate their offices, apartments, and hotel rooms, thus affecting the player's bottom line and the building's \"Star\" rating.",

Earwigs, Inchworms, Dragonflies, and Beetles are all out to make sure this battle is your last. Shoot all of the bugs before they bite you! Super Breakout: This updated version of one of the greatest coin-op classics offers all of the game variations that the original game offered. The goal is simply to knock out all of the visible bricks using as few balls as possible. Lunar Lander is the first one player game to authentically simulate an actual moon landing mission. It provides the thrills and the realistic \"feel\" of controlled space flight! Players are challenged to control thrust and rotation of a lunar landing craft to counteract simulated gravitational pull, momentum and friction.",

However, men are quick to covet things which offer strength, and easily corrupted by the might which they possess. Seduced by the promised power of the Crystals, the kingdom of Baron begins employing unprovoked force to seize them from peaceful nations. The dark knight Cecil - Lord Captain of Baron's elite force, the Red Wings - is ordered by his king to obtain the Crystals, but soon begins to question the monarch's motives. Stricken with grief at his own actions, yet burdened by his loyalty to his country and his personal sense of honor, Cecil at last decides to turn from the path of darkness and destruction. Enraged, the king accuses him of disloyalty, strips Cecil of his command, and sends him off to slay a mysterious beast that lurks in the nearby Valley of Mist. Cecil embarks on a fateful journey that will bring trials, betrayals, friendship, loss and self-discovery. Can Cecil open his eyes and become the man of honor that he must be? Dive into the first RPG to incorporate the innovative Active Time Battle system, now further enhanced and refined for the Nintendo DS.

    "description": "FINAL FANTASY VI first debuted in 1994 as the sixth installment in the iconic FINAL FANTASY series. Innovations included the ability to play all the main characters as the game's protagonist, and to this day, its epic story intertwining each of their fates is still highly rated and wildly popular. The characters' dramatic performances are also highly rated, including the catastrophe occurring midway through, which delivers a particular emotional jolt to players.\n\nWith plenty of abilities available and the magicite system for controlling spells/summoning, players can develop their characters any way they want. This was also the first FINAL FANTASY game to include the Ultima Weapon, the most powerful sword of all and a recurring item in subsequent titles within the series.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Game data saved with iCloud can now be shared across devices! At home or away, on your iPhone or iPad, pick the play style that's best for you.\n\n* All graphics have been painstakingly recreated, bringing the world of FINAL FANTASY VI to your mobile device for the very first time! Kazuko Shibuya, one of the graphics designers involved in the FINAL FANTASY series from the very start, personally worked on the main characters and supervised the recreation of the game's graphics.\n\n* Square Enix's vast experience in A-list smartphone RPG titles has been harnessed in implementing intuitive user-friendly controls that make the game easy to play on touch screens. The battle interface has received particular attention, with a complete overhaul for use on your smartphone.\n\n* This smartphone release includes the new magicites and events that were introduced in the 2006 remake.\n\n* Some events have been optimized to be played with user-friendly touch controls.\n\nStory\n\nThe War of Magi left little but ashes and misery in its wake. Even magic itself had vanished from the world. Now, a thousand years later, humankind has remade the world through the power of iron, gunpowder, steam engines, and other machines and technologies.\n\nBut there is one who possesses the lost power of magic--a young girl name Terra whom the evil Empire has kept enslaved in an effort to harness her power as weapon. This leads to a fateful meeting between Terra and a young man named Locke. Their harrowing escape from the Empire's clutches sets in motion a series of events that touches countless lives and leads to one inevitable conclusion.",

Each character has a unique special move that players will need to utilize in order to complete the game. Getting through obstacles would be Cera's job, since she can smash things with her bone-plated head. Petrie, on the other hand, is the only member of this Mesozoic motley crew that can fly, making him very valuable for hard-to-reach areas. The game controls are designed to be easy to master, making this an adventure even the littlest gamer can handle.",

When a domesticated grizzly named Boog gets lured into leaving the creature comforts of home by a fast-talking mule deer named Elliott, he finds himself lost in the woods just three days before hunting season begins. Forced to \"rough it\" in the great outdoors, Boog goes native, rallying all the forest animals to take back their home and send the hunters packing. Interact with Beth, Shaw, and all your animal favorites from the Open Season film. Throw skunk bombs, hurl rabbits, use acorn-firing squirrels, and pull outrageous woodland pranks to scare the pants off the hunters. Roll in a giant snowball, ride the rapids on a floating outhouse, zip through tunnels in a crazy mine cart ride, and take on more madcap adventures as Boog discovers how to go from \"Mild\" to \"Wild\". Challenge your friends or team up together in 4-player mini-games.",

    "description": "Tomb Raider: Legend revives the athletic, intelligent and entertaining adventurer who won the hearts and minds of gamers worldwide. Lara comes alive with intricately animated expressions, moves and abilities. An arsenal of modern equipment, such as a magnetic grappling device, binoculars, frag grenades, personal lighting device and communications equipment, allows gamers to experience tomb raiding as never before. Eidos and Crystal Dynamics shaped Lara's look and movements to be an inherent extension of her skills, motivation and personality. Lara's character model features natural structure, realistic textures, detailed facial features, reactive eyes and fluid motion, all of which make her part of a living environment. New character animations and controls allow her to move through stunning environments with grace and precision, while an understanding of the game's original appeal reinvigorates the fundamental explore-and-solve adventure experience.",

    "description": "Sims Have New Friends - Pets! Sims can share their lives with their new pets and add more fun to the Sims experience. From dogs, cats, caged animals and more, your Sims share new friends to experience life's precious moments. With so many different animals to choose from, there's no telling what unpredictable experiences could occur. Create-A-Pet: Choose from dozens of dog and cat breeds or customize features for a one-of-a-kind pet. You can even modify your pet's body shape by choosing from specific colors and unique markings. Don't like the way they act? Change their personality - from smart and sweet to silly and sloppy - anyone can create their ideal animal friend in The Sims 2 Pets. Your Sims can encourage and discipline pets, training them to shake, roll over, play dead, and more. Unruly pets might dig in the yard, claw the sofa, or topple the trash. Thankfully, a little training can go a long way. Create and control digital characters over a lifetime, setting their goals in life from popularity and romance, to fortune and family- their stories are in your hands. Use special codes to share unlockable pet accessories, fur types or markings with other The Sims 2 Pets players. Your Sims' pets are members of the family and share all of life's great moments - whether it's kids training puppies, teens playing fetch in the park, adults watching TV with their cats, or elders enjoying a sunny day in the park with their long-time companion. Your Sims pets have genetics, allowing you to create the latest designer pet, including popular hybrid breeds like the Labradoodle, Puggle and Schnoodle! Like what you've created? Register them to appear in Create-A-Pet as a unique pedigree. Sims aren't the only ones with careers anymore! Skilled pets can earn a living from three career tracks - Show Business, Security, and Service - and work their way up through five job levels.",

While in control of a monster players can throw toxic stink bombs, call lightning down from the sky, fire lasers beams from their eyes or even impale enemies with a massive scorpion tail - use all of the creatures' special abilities to defeat Neo and Nina Cortex. Crash now has a powerful acrobatic fighting system that includes punches and flying kicks, multiple attacks and special counter moves. Players can power-up skills to unlock new attacks and blazing combos. Crash can now interact with his world in totally new ways. Players can wall-run, swing from ropes and flip off springboards Crash can even toss Aku Aku on the ground to surf, skate, grind and shred. At any point in the game, a second player can join in the fun and play as Carbon-Crash to help unleash total chaos. In a totally innovative twist to co-op action gaming, Crash can even jack Carbon-Crash (or vice versa) for some hysterical Crash \"jacked\"-Crash mayhem.",
